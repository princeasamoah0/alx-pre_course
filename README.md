This project is very amazing. It teaches professional web development using powertools like atom, vscode, etc.
I have done a great deal of work in this ALX course. From Git commit to forking to branching to rebasing etc.
I am making new pragmatic changes to my GitHub Account Profile.
I hope everyone gets what I'm talking about with full precision
